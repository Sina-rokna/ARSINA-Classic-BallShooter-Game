# ARSINA: Classic BallShooter Game

**ARSINA: Classic BallShooter Game** is a C++ arcade-style color-matching shooter built using **SDL2** and its extensions (**SDL_image**, **SDL_ttf**, **SDL_mixer**, and **SDL2_gfx**).  
Your goal is to clear the moving balls from the path before they reach the end by shooting balls of the same color to form groups of three or more.  

The game includes **four gameplay modes**:  
- **Erasure Mode** – Clear all balls from the path.  
- **Timer Mode** – Clear balls continuously generated during an 80-second match.  
- **Stones Mode** – Clear paths for the stones to reach the end.  
- **Free Birds Mode** – Free all birds trapped along the path.  

Each mode provides a different challenge and scoring system.  
Special balls such as **Joker**, **Stone**, **Bird**, **Question**, and **Ice** introduce unique mechanics.  
Random **time effects** like *Pause*, *Slow Motion*, and *Reverse* add more strategy to the gameplay.  

You can unlock and activate **special power-ups** after victories, including:  
- **Fire Power** – Removes a single ball per use.  
- **Bomb Power** – Destroys nearby groups of balls.  
- **Thunder Power** – Eliminates all balls under the lightning zone.  
- **Filter Power** – Removes all balls of the same kind as the targeted one.  
- **Jackpot Power** – Clears all balls from the path.  

Developed entirely in **C++17** with **SDL2**, this project recreates the charm of classic marble-shooter arcade games with smooth physics, colorful effects, and nostalgic gameplay.
